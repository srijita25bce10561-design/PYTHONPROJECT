PROBLEM STATEMENT : 

Typing speed and accuracy are essential skills for students and professionals in today’s digital world. However, most beginners who start coding are unaware of their current typing abilities because they lack simple tools that can quickly measure how fast and accurately they type.
Thus, there is a need for a basic, easy-to-use Python tool that can display a sentence, record typing time, calculate typing speed, and detect typing errors.
This project solves this problem by providing a simple command-line typing speed calculator that helps users evaluate and improve their typing performance.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:

The scope of the typing speed calculator project includes : 
      A) The user gets a randomly selected sentence to type.
      B) The user gets to know how much total time he or she has taken to type the sentence.
      C) This project detects and displays mistakes by comparing user input with the original sentence. 
      D) The project has been designed in such a manner that it provides a simple , terminal based interface suitable for begineers.

TARGET USERS: 

The primary users targetted to learn the project are: 

    A) Students: 
       The B.Tech 1st year CSE students or students learning Python who want to practice typing are the main targetted users here. 
       
    B) Teachers and Instructors:
       the target users are also the educators who need a simple tool to demonstrate:
       i) usage of time function and time module
       ii)string comparison
       iii)loops
       
    C) Anyone interested in Typing Skill improvement:
       The target users are also general users who want a quick and simple way to check their typing speed without any complex software.

HIGH LEVEL FEATURES OF THE PROJECT:

    1. Random Test Sentence Generation :

       The program randomly selects a sentence from a predefined list, ensuring variety and preventing memorization.

    2. Typing Speed Calculation :

       It calculates typing speed in characters per second, providing a direct measurement of typing performance using time() function from the time() module.
       
    3. Error Detection Mechanism

       Each character typed by the user is compared with the original sentence to detect the mistakes accurately which helps beginners to understand.

    4. Beginner-Friendly Command-Line Interface

       The design is simple, text-based, and easy to understand for new learners.
